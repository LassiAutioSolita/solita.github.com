Practically every developer know what is test-driven development aka. TDD. But behaviour-driven development (BDD) is not that popular and many don't
know what it is in practice. Some of us have heard and read about it but haven't tried it. In this blog post I will give some introduction to BDD
and how it can be done with C# and SpecFlow. SpecFlow is a free plugin for Visual Studio that enables BDD with Visual Studio.

## Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)

Very famous test-driven development (TDD) is only for developers. Automated end-to-end tests are for developers and testers. What important stakeholder is missing? It is the business people. BDD is something that is for all three stakeholders: developers, testers, and business.
